            still a little proud to show them of.

            <p>
              I'm a <em>designer born in Belgium</em>. I like doing anything
              creative from drawing, making things from cardboard to sewing my
              own clothes. While my heart belongs to design I'm (not so)
              secretly also in love with coding. I love a good organised
              database and animating my design with code or in after effects.

            I studied science with 8 hours of math in high school, where I
            discovered my love for programming anew after using scratch when I
            was younger.
          </p>
          <p class="education__p">
            I stumbled upon Devine by accident and immediately knew this would
            be the school for me. <em
              >Devine balances all the areas I wanted to study further: the
              creative the logical and the human.</em
            > In my third year at the Devine I got the change to spend a semester
            at <em> Hanyang in south-Korea.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="education__p">
            When I was twelve I started going to the Sint-Lucas Academie, an art
            academy in Gent. After seven years in the kids program I started the
            two year initian course. I completed the initiation course and got
            the degree when I was 19.
