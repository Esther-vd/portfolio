## The brief

For this integration project, we had to make a website for the <em>Plantin Moretus Museum</em>. The museum is based in Antwerp and enlightens the visitors on the story of the printing press. When we visited the museum, we experienced a guided tour around the museum where we learned about the history of the Plantin family and the technical aspects of the printing press. We had to turn this same story, with a focus on Christopher Plantin, into a long-form content website.

Just like in the museum, visitors to the website discover how Plantin lived his life, building a printing empire. Through interactive elements, the visitor can engage with the story and even learn more about some of the more technical aspects of printing books in the 16th century. We had a <em> month to create a functional, working website from scratch</em>.

## The process

I decided to focus on telling Plantin’s business story in such a way that visitors to the website feel they are discovering his story by finding an old newspaper. Fracturing his story into Newsclippings, old objects, or pictures found between the pages of a forgotten newspaper. Making visitors feel like they are <em> discovering a lost part of history</em>.

This was a design style that really challenged my Photoshop abilities, having never before tried to make digital elements look like real paper clippings. But I quickly found out I enjoyed this challenge very much. The website is more minimally designed to not distract from the news clippings. So being able to design the fake pamphlets and different stamps was a refreshing change of pace. This project truly allowed me to <em> experiment with and stretch my knowledge of both Photoshop and Illustrator. </em>

Because I never think about the fact that I also have to code my designs afterwards, the CCS part of this website is the biggest challenge of this whole project. While I’d become pretty used to coding crazy designs with CSS, this still taught me a lot of things. (Like patience) After the CSS came the fun: GSAP. <em> Seeing my design slowly come to life made all the struggeling worth it. </em> Diffferent JavaScript techniques were used to make the interactions work. I taught myself to work with device motion and to handle the differences in mobile systems.

## The final result

The final result of a month of hard work is a responsive website with scrollytelling and multiple interactive elements. Try it out on both mobile and desktop to see the difference. And just like my teachers during the Jury moment, you can have fun shaking your device around and colouring outside of the lines.
